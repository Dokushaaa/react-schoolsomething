in helpers if you want to change the folder name : {

look: 
export const baseImgUrl  = "../../../public/img";
//const baseImgUrl = 'http://
[export const urlPathSchool = "http://localhost/react-dashboard";]
export const devApiUrl = `${urlPathSchool}/rest`;
export const devKey =
"$2a$12$47wDvbLInZif/PVS8B6P3.7WxyJvUpBzZAWCsnWJUKq3nrn4qgmeO";

change url after "http://localhost/" to corresponding new foldername

}
